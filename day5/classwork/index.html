In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers
to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee
specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used";
an encyclopedia is the first entry.
