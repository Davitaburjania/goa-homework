<p>
     The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.
     It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the 
     domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but
     it also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability 
     to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong,
     flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is
     a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.

<h3>shows</h3>
<P> 
    A cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations 
     by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard. It is often required that a cat must be healthy and
     vaccinated to participate in a cat show. Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion ("moggy") cats are admissible, 
     although the rules differ depending on the organization. Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard,
     and assessed fortemperament.

<h3>infections</h3>
<p> 
    Cats can be infected or infested with viruses, pathogenic bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that 
     can transmit diseases to humans; infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease, and toxoplasmosis.
     In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease. The same disease can then become evident in a human.
     The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person. Others might
     also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body
