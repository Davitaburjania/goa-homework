        Tokyo Tower is an iconic communications and observation tower located in the Shiba-koen district of the
        Minato ward. Built in 1958, its design is inspired by the Eiffel Tower and is painted white and international
        orange to comply with air safety regulations. Although the taller Tokyo Skytree now serves as the primary broadcast 
        tower, Tokyo Tower remains a major tourist attraction with two observation decks and a multi-story entertainment
        complex at its base.
